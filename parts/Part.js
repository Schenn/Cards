/**
 * A Part is a class that interacts with it's parent component's attributes.

 *    component element it can be affected by a part.
 *
 * Some parts may only work with a parent components observable attributes,
 *  however, that is not the default nature of the part's functionality.
 *
 * A part sub-class must extend from this class.
