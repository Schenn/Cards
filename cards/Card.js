/**
 * Abstract Card Class
 *
 * Extend from this class to create a Card based Custom Element.
 *
 * At its' root, "Cards" represents two things
 *  -  Component Architecture Responsive Design System
 *  -  A collection of loosely, optionally connected content containers which self-describe
 *       their components and establish any reactive effect which should take place in addition
 *       to the component's internal functionality.
 *
 * A Card is a custom element which serves a larger purpose than a component and requires components to work.
 *  The Card's template structure declares what components should be created,
 *    what the initial values for the component properties should be,
 *    what parts should be applied to which components to extend their capability without
 *      changing the components themselves.
 *    Any other HTML that should be in it's structure.
 *
 * An example of a Card might be a Blog Post Node. Something which has a title Component,
 *    a content component, an author component, some additional HTML, and gives access to the user
 *      to update those values if the user has permission.
 *
 * Card's don't have Observable Properties.
 *  They only have two non-observed properties which are meant to be overridden,
 *    the static tag and the instance template.
 * Cards should use Components to manage other properties
 *  That doesn't mean you shouldn't give your Card any Attributes.
 *  Just understand that there isn't anything currently in the app that will provide a benefit to doing so.
 *
 * @abstract
 * @todo Slot an optional style element. Thus allowing the Card to manage the styles of its components
